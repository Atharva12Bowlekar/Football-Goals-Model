# Football-Goals-Model
Scoring a goal in football stands as the ultimate objective, an end product of various factors. To achieve this objective, two important factors influence a player's goal-scoring potential, the angle of the shot and the distance from the goal. This report accesses deeply the importance of angle and distance, decoding their important roles in shaping the likelihood of a player's goal-scoring ability.

The angle assumed by a player in approaching the goal is key into changing goal-scoring odds. A slender angle, one where the player moves closer to the goal line meaning a smaller target for goalkeepers to protect. 

This makes it difficult for players to find the ideal balance between accuracy and power. Shots taken from a slender angle often require accuracy to avoid hitting the goalposts, while shots from a wider angle need greater power to beat the goalkeeper's reach.

Equally important, the distance from the goal is an important deciding factor for goal-scoring likelihood. Shots taken from shorter distances generally have a higher likelihood of success due to reduced reaction time for goalkeepers and increased accuracy for shooters. This becomes particularly evident during one-on-one matchups, as the goalkeeper's ability to cover gaps and respond effectively to the shot is compromised due to their proximity to the action.

Long range shots, though, have a lower likelihood of scoring. The increased distance affords goalkeepers an extended timeframe to access and reposition, minimising the element of surprise. Moreover, the power needed for distant strikes often have less precision and accuracy, making these shots less likely of finding the back of the net.

The combination between angle and distance further emphasizes their combined significance. Close-range shots taken from acute angles startle goalkeepers due to the unpredictable trajectories they adopt. Conversely, shots from a greater distance but at a good angle might have a higher chance of scoring because the goalie's positioning is compromised.

Football's essence lies in the intricate fusion of accuracy, power, angle, and distance to score a goal. The importance of angle and distance cannot be understated, as it directly impacts the goal-scoring probability. Players must strategically choose their angles and distances, based on context of the match, defender placements, goalkeepers' positioning, and their own technical abilities. Managers and players, acknowledging this significant role, should incorporate these facets into training and game strategies to optimize their goal-scoring opportunities.

The model that I have made takes in distance from goal and angle of the shot to goal as independent variables and if the shot resulted into a goal as the dependent variable based on these attributes for a striker in a given tournament or a season the model is trained. After training the model with the initial player it is used to predict the total goal output of another player through his shot attributes that were the angle of the shot and the distance from the goal. Doing this we can compare each striker with another and can provide statistical evidence to suggest which striker is better than the other. This is also later done to compare performances of goalkeepers. The modelling is done by a generalised linear model in combination with the binomial function.
